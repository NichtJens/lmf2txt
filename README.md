# lmf2txt

Modified version of lmf2txt as originally found under:

http://www.atom.uni-frankfurt.de/czasch/default_files/software/LMF_tools/lmf2txt/lmf2txt.zip

Original project:

https://github.com/NichtJens/lmf2txt

Can be compiled under macOS/Linux via a simple `cmake ROOTDIR && make all`, or `pip install ROOTDIR`. Here `ROOTDIR` is
root directory of this project.

The Visual Studio project for Windows compilation should also still work fine. It hasn't been tested, though...
